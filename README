 * About *
 *********
  
  dWiNA is an implementation of backward decision procedure for WSkS logic 
  (weak second-order theory of k successors). The tool is using libvata a 
  highly optimised non-deterministic finite tree automata library that supports 
  semi-symbolic encoding using multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs) for
  storing transition table of the automaton. Procedure generates state space on-the-fly
  and prunes the states using the antichain-based approach. State space is represented 
  by downward and upward closed represenation of states. The tool computes the 
  representation of final states and test if initial states are included in final states 
  and thus (dis)prove validity.
  
 * Prerequisities *
 ******************
 
 Following packages are needed in order to compile and run dWiNA on your system:

 	git (>= 1.6.0.0)
 	cmake (>= 2.8.2)
 	gcc (>= 4.8.0)
 	flex (>= 2.5.35)
 	bison (>= 2.7.1)
 	
 * Compilation *
 ***************
 
 In order to prepare the tool for compilation and commiting a background check for
 prerequisite package issue the following command in the root directory of the tool:
 
   $ cmake CMakeLists.txt
   
 To further compile the source files to runable binary issue the following command:
 
   $ make
