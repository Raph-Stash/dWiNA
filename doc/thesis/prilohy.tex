\chapter{Contents of CD}

In main directory of the cd, there is a \texttt{cmake} source for compilation of
the application.

\paragraph{Directory \texttt{/doc/thesis}}

Contains \LaTeX sources with Makefile for compilation of thesis.

\paragraph{Directory \texttt{/examples/formulae}}

Contains examples written in \textsc{MONA} syntax for deciding. Ranging from
simple examples used for testing functionality to more complex ones used for
evaluation of created code.

\paragraph{Directory \texttt{/include/vata}}

Contains headers needed to be included during compilation of program for part of
the functions that are used from library \texttt{VATA}.

\paragraph{Directory \texttt{/src/app/DecisionProcedure}}

Contains main part of the application sources that does the conversion of given
representation of formulae into automaton and afterwards the procedure of
deciding validity or satisfiability.

\paragraph{Directory \texttt{/src/app/Frontend}}

Contains part of the sources that does the parsing of the input formulae
specification into inner representation in program

\paragraph{Directory \texttt{/src/libs}}

Contains external libraries that are used in application. Namely these are
several libraries needed for \textsc{MONA} part and library for manipulating
with NTA \textsc{VATA}.

\chapter{WS$k$S specification syntax}\label{syntax}

\chapter{Usage}
The usage of the decision procedure tool is:
\begin{center}
 \texttt{dip [options] <filename>}
\end{center}
\texttt{<filename>} is relative or absolute path to specification of WS$k$S
formula as defined by syntax described in Appendix \ref{syntax}. The options
that can be further set are following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[\texttt{-t}],\texttt{--time}\,--\,prints elapsed time for decision
  procedure and further information about timing of procedure.
  \item[\texttt{-d}],\texttt{--dump-all}\,--\,dumps information about AST
  representation of given formula, symbol table, created automaton and etc.
  \item[\texttt{-q}],\texttt{--quiet}\,--\,suppress printing of information
  about decision process.
  \item[\texttt{--reorder-bdd}]\,--\,by default variables are reorder according
  to the prefix of the given formula. This can be suppressed by adding parameter
  \texttt{no} or random reordering can be done by option \texttt{random}.
\end{itemize}
